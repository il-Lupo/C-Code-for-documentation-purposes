# C-Code-for-documentation-purposes
I've been in the mood for C again after a long time, and I'm in the process of writing a header file this time that I can include in future C projects to make things easier. I want to have some functions that I know from my work with the .NET framework (for example String.Split() and String.Contains()). Furthermore, there are many useful little things in the header file.

I created the project using Visual Studio 2019 Community. As project template I chose “C++ empty console application”, but I renamed the file to Main.c and made settings that the code is compiled as C code.

The project is debugged as x64.

The functions and variables are in English, the output in the console is in German.
